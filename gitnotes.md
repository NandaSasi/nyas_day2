# Git Notes

These are my notes on git.

*`git init`: initializes repository
*`git status`: tell us status of repo
*`git add`: adds files to be tracked
*`git commit`: dedicate myself to a version
*`git diff`: shows the difference between the version before git add and git commit
*`git log`: shows all the versions and a unique identifier to call it
